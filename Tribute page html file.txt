            <p>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, (born October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, <br> India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong), Indian scientist and politician who played a leading role in the development <br> of India’s missile and nuclear weapons programs. He was president of India from 2002 to 2007. Kalam earned <br> a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence <br> Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, <br> where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced <br> in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles,<br> which helped earn him the nickname “Missile Man.” Among those successes was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range <br> ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989. From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was <br> scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government <br> with the rank of cabinet minister. His prominent role in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear <br> power and established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international community. <br> In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for <br> transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. The plan called for, among other measures, <br> increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to <br> health care and education.Kalam wrote several books, including an autobiography, Wings of Fire (1999). <br> Among his numerous awards were two of the country’s highest honours, the Padma Vibhushan (1990) and the Bharat Ratna (1997).</p>
